An Application for my CSA3209 Class. This is to locate all the maltese firework station and the emergancy services that surround them. This will be implemented int HTML5, utilizing the wonderful Geo-location. Google maps will also be used for the maping aspects. PHP for the back end database that i will be using to make all the user accounts and the content management. In time I will be adding a CMS but for now all the content is managed by a database and some PHP that i wrote from scretch. This I have done for the sake of learning. I am new to web development and design. Thanks and please do tell me if there things i can improve on coding wise. Cheers and enjoy fellow coders.
